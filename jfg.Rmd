While completing this project, we had a blast looking at Emma's training / race day photos and videos. To share the fun, we made this tab to show some of our favorite descriptions and photos!


### Photos

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%", out.height = "30%", fig.show = 'hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Emma and her mom celebrating mile 21 with a Gu-cheers!"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/emma+mom_cheers.JPG", "images/emma+mom_cheers2.JPG"))
```
